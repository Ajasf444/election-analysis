## Challenge Overview
The purpose of this election audit is to follow up the analysis done for this congressional election with analysis based on the counties involved.
This information could be leveraged in future campaigns to allow candidates to focus their messages in certain counties.
## Challenge Summary
This script could be repurposed to address presidential elections as the counties variable and text could be changed to states and electoral college votes.
Another way this script could be used for elections would be for local elections and the county accounting portion of the script could be disabled.
On a completely different note this script could be repurposed to account for any preference, e.g., favorite soft drinks.
Just the appropriate messages that are printed out would need to be changed.
